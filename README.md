#### 001 Landsat 8 Classification plus spectra chart
Classification Example for Landsat 8 plus spectra for classes in classified region.

#### 002 Landsat 8 TOA Tasseled Cap Transformation:
Tasseled Cap Transformation for Landsat 8 based on the scientfic work "Derivation of a tasselled cap transformation based on Landsat 8 at-satellite reflectance" by M.Baigab, L.Zhang, T.Shuai & Q.Tong (2014). The bands of the output image are the brightness index, greenness index and wetness index.
